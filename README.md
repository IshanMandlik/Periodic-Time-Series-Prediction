# Periodic-Time-Series-Prediction
Time series forecasting is a fundamental task in many real-world applications, from finance to climate science. While current machine learning models have achieved remarkable success in domains such as image and text processing, periodic time series (PTS) data presents unique challenges that many models struggle to address.

Most existing ML models excel at short-term predictions but lack the ability to accurately model long-term dependencies and capture periodic patterns inherent in time series data. These limitations often lead to suboptimal performance when forecasting over extended time horizons, especially in scenarios requiring temporal extrapolation. This challenge is also sometimes referred as fitting a trajectory of a given equation.

This project aims to push the boundaries of traditional models by focusing on:

Modeling periodicity – Effectively capturing the cyclic nature of PTS data, where values exhibit repeated trends over time.
Extrapolation capabilities – Encouraging the development of models that can predict future time points accurately, even beyond the observed time window.
Minimizing error in long-term forecasts – Addressing the degradation of model performance in predicting future values over longer sequences.

Through this project, we will develop innovative approaches to overcome these limitations, enhancing the field of time series forecasting with models better suited for long-term periodic trends.
